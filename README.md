A simple Todo list app demo created using React

It uses Axios to automatically get the Todos from an API

Changes don't save after reloading because it's a serverless frontend demo

## Features

- Adding / Deleting todos
- Toggling them as complete / uncomplete
- An 'About' page using react-router-dom
- Getting todos from a web API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)
- Sending Put / Delete requests to the web API
- Use UUID's for all the todos to fix responses from the fake API

## Running

Run `npm install` to install dependencies and `npm start` to run the demo
